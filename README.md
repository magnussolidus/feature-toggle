# Feature Toggle Experiments

This repository purpose is for one to experiment with the [native feature toggle management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.featuremanagement?view=azure-dotnet) provided by microsoft.

I am making a Calculator that deals with some async code and with the feature management. 
Later I will add a Rules Engine to help setting up the features.

> Note: This is a Work In Progress repo
